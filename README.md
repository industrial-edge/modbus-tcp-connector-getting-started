## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge application Modbus TCP Connector to establish a connection between an Industrial Edge Device (IED) and a PLC that supports Modbus TCP, a data communications protocol (client/server) that runs on Ethernet.

The Modbus TCP Connector is an application that runs on the individual IED. It can communicate with any Modbus TCP PLC that uses the standard protocol. Connections can be configured using the Common Configurato for Industrial Edge. The connector transfers the value series of selected data points from a PLC to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps, e.g. the Flow Creator.

### General task

Here we configure a connection between a Modbus server and client. The IED acts as the Modbus client and the Modbus server can be any hardware that is able to instantiate standard Modbus communication. The data is published on the IE Databus. By using the application IE Flow Creator, we fetch the metadata of the Modbus TCP Connector, write some data on the configured tags and read out data.
